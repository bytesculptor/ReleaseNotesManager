# Release Notes Manager (work in progress)

- Written for Android Studio
- Automate some work regarding release notes translations for the App Store
- Have the same release notes as a history in the app

## Overview

Translating the release notes for the Google Play Store can be a lot of manual work, depending on how many languages
your app supports. The idea of this app is to write the release notes once per release in every released languages. Then
to have them as a history in the app and having an auto generated file for the Google Play Store.
